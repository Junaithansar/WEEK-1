# WEEK-1
Agriculture faces huge losses due to undetected plant diseases. Manual detection is slow and inaccurate, leading to lower yield and excess pesticide use. An AI-based crop disease detection system using CNN can identify diseases early, support timely treatment, and promote sustainable farming.

Agricultural Importance:
Agriculture plays a vital role in global food production and economic stability, supporting millions of livelihoods worldwide.

Current Challenge:
Farmers face major losses every year due to plant diseases and pest attacks that go undetected or are identified too late.

Limitations of Manual Inspection:
Disease detection is mostly done manually through visual observation, which is slow, labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to human errorâ€”especially when covering large-scale farms.

Consequences of Late Detection:
Delayed or inaccurate identification leads to reduced crop yield, poor quality of produce, and substantial economic losses for farmers.

Environmental Impact:
To compensate for yield loss, farmers often overuse fertilizers, pesticides, and water, leading to soil degradation, pollution, and long-term environmental harm.

Need for Automation:
There is an urgent need for an intelligent and automated solution that can accurately detect and classify crop diseases at an early stage.

Role of Artificial Intelligence:
Advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can analyze leaf images to identify healthy and diseased crops automatically.

Proposed Solution:
The project proposes the development of an AI-based crop disease detection system that uses CNN models trained on leaf image datasets to classify plant diseases with high accuracy.

Advantages of the Proposed System:

Enables early disease detection and timely treatment

Reduces excessive use of pesticides and water

Increases crop yield and profitability

Promotes sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture

Alignment with Sustainability Goals:
The project contributes to sustainable farming practices by improving resource efficiency, minimizing chemical use, and supporting environmental protection.

Overall Objective:
To build an intelligent system that assists farmers in making data-driven decisions, ensuring higher productivity and sustainable agricultural development for future generations.
